//! This crate lets you write an iterator into a LinesWriter, with each item on a line.
//!
//! The trait is implemented for all the types that implement `std::io::Write`.
//! Simply call write_lines on the writer and pass an iterator as argument.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```rust
//! use lines_writer::LinesWriter;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let str = "This is\na string\nto show\nhow do\nthis work";
//!     std::io::stdout().write_lines(str.lines()).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ```rust
//! use lines_writer::LinesWriter;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let array = [10, 15, 63, 29];
//!     std::io::stdout().write_lines(&array).unwrap();
//! }
//! ```
